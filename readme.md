## Reflection

This assignment provided a comprehensive opportunity to deepen my understanding of secure web application development and collaborative software engineering. Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) required careful planning of user permissions and a robust system for enforcing access policies throughout the application. The process of adding email validation and verification not only improved user experience but also enhanced the security posture of the platform. Addressing edge cases in profile updates and strengthening password security further solidified my grasp of best practices in user data management and authentication.

Collaboration played a key role in the success of this project. Regular code reviews and issue tracking helped maintain code quality and ensured that all features aligned with project requirements. One of the main challenges was balancing security enhancements with usability, especially when implementing stricter validation rules. Through iterative testing and feedback, I learned to design solutions that are both secure and user-friendly. Overall, this assignment reinforced the importance of clear communication, thorough testing, and continuous improvement in software development.
